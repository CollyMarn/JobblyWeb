      <div class="answer">
        <p><strong>Strategy:</strong> Demonstrate your proactive approach and genuine interest in the company.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> "I've been following your company's growth in renewable energy solutions and was excited to see this opening on your careers page.

      <div class="answer">
        <p><strong>Strategy:</strong> Align your answer with the company's known culture while being authentic.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> "I thrive in collaborative environments where teams work together to solve complex problems, which I understand is a key part of your company culture. At the same time, I appreciate having autonomy to manage my projects and deadlines. Your mention of weekly cross-departmental brainstorming sessions in the job description particularly appealed to me."</p>
      </div>

        <p><strong>Strategy:</strong> Show self-awareness, coping mechanisms, and a growth mindset.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> "I've developed a three-step approach to stressful situations: First, I assess priorities to focus on what matters most. Second, I break large problems into manageable steps. Third, I communicate proactively with stakeholders. During our product launch last quarter, this approach helped me coordinate between engineering and marketing when we had to accelerate our timeline by two weeks."</p>
